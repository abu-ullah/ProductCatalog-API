# WorkoutLog-API

• Developing a workout tracking API/backend using Flask, Python, and MongoDB, enabling users to securely track their workouts, set goals, and 
monitor exercise progression by logging exercises, sets, reps, and intensity.

•	Implemented data validation, secure authentication, and authorization mechanisms, along with comprehensive error handling to safeguard the integrity and confidentiality of data.

Started implementing a workout tracking web application using EJS, NodeJS, and React to integrate this API: https://github.com/abu-ullah/WorkoutLog-App
